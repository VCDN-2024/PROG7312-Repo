#### Implementing an Array Data Structure for SpaceVC
To keep it simple, the first data structure that we will explore is the Array data structure. 
 
You are tasked with creating an application named SpaceVC that allows us to manage a fleet of spaceships. 
 
Your task: Implement a custom array class with the minimum capability for a client class to add an element, search for an element, remove elements, and output the contents of the array. 
 
Every Spaceship in our fleet has a name, model, crew capacity, max speed, status (active, inactive, maintenance), launch date, mission type (research, transport, military, communications).
 
It would be wise to ensure that your custom array class can handle any type of data (and not just Spaceship objects).
 
You can refer to the dotnet documentation for inspiration on what additional array functionality you can add to your custom array.
 
Optional: Since we are looking at a custom array implementation, amend your custom array class to allow for the array to be resized, if the client wishes to resize the array.
